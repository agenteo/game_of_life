# GameOfLife

This is a partial implementation of [Conway's game of life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).
The code retreat constraint for the 40 minutes session was no conditional statements. This is the solution another team suggested that I wanted to write myself after the retreat.

The hash dictionary is used as a mean to deliver conditional statement.
